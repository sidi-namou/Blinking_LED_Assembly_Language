# Blinking_LED_Assembly_Language
Blinking LED using ARM assembly language

# In this project 
You will find one file main.s that contains the assembly code to blink led
I used in this project STM32L152RE if you want to try this code on any ARM cortex M board you have to make sure that these addresses that i set are the same in your board.

Regards.
